# Text Mining course
This is a carpentries style text mining course which under development.  It is targetted at humanities and social science students and researchers who have no experience in text mining.

The course is scheduled to run over two days and we are currently doing trial runs to collect feedback, add further explanations and make changes where needed.

We run the course using Jupyter Notebook and start with a list of prerequisites needed to get going.
